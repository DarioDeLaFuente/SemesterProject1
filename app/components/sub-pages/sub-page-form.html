      <h2>Volunteer</h2>
      <small><i>
        A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and
        ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see
        behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch
        where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and
        strategies for the museum. You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
        contact us if youâ€™d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
