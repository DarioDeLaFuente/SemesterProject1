    <p>
      For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins.
      Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution
      we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world. Discover the
      origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You
      can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didnâ€™t survive, including our
      Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.
