      Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the
      night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
      constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who
      used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
      traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.
