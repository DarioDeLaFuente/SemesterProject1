      On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the
      Community Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the
      power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind
      Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.
