      Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science
      accessible to all. Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
      understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away
      to the very building blocks of life itself. The aim of our museum is to create a space where
      everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
      passion to continue the exploration of the world around us. We believe science should not be
      confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
      different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits
      are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from
      the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
